Missouri S&amp;T Thesis Class and Templates


Bibliography style file replacements (2021/01/27)

The repository now contains two distinct bst files: 
 - mstogs-num.bst, and
 - mstogs-auy.bst.
 
Both bst files are for use with natbib, but differ as to whether the reference/bibliography listing is in numerical order of citation or alphabetized.  
The second file, mstogs-auy.bst, produces an alphabetized list and is most appropriately used with the authoryear natbib package option.
The first file, mstogs-num.bst, should be used with the numbers package option to produce a numbered reference list corresponding to order of citation.
The two files match OGS-specified formatting of thesis/dissertation bibliographies and similar in function to unsrtnat.bst and plainnat.bst, which
are two of the bibliography style files supplied with the natbib package.  The custom-bib source code, in the form of dbj files, are included with 
the repository to allow for changes, as necessary.


Notes for version 4.0 (2018/08/07)

Compatibility note (VERY IMPORTANT): the name of the class file was changed from mstthesis.cls to mstogs.cls. This means that all prior templates will, by default, load an outdated class file. From v4.0 (2018/08/07) forward, the correct class file name to be called in the root thesis/dissertation tex file is mstogs.cls.

The final version of the Thesis/Dissertation Specifications included several changes not included in the version 3.4 class and templates. The present version of the class file (mstogs.cls), as well as the bibliography style file (mstogs.bst), now provide output which matches the formally-approved OGS Thesis/Dissertation Specifications that were officially approved in Spring 2018.

In particular, changes include:
1. Edits to the formatting and numbering of sectioning for both the report class thesis (rpc) and the publication-option thesis (pto),
2. Layout for the List of Figures, Tables, etc.

Notes for version 3.4 (2017/10/11)

Numerous revisions of both the class file and the associated templates
to bring the formatting to current OGS standard.  The proofs generated
by the current class and templates match the draft OGS Thesis
Specifications now in the campus-level review process.

Among other things, changes include:
1. Addition of a bibliography style file (mstogs.bst) which produces
desired formatting both using numbers and authoryear package options
for natbib.
2. TOC spacing is now consistent for all multi-line headings.

Notes for version 3.2 (2017/03/23)

Provides fixes for several issues raised by OGS reviews of spring 2017 theses and disserations.

1. Provides more flexible title page specification of advisor and committee
2. Provides correct hanging indent for authoryear citations
3. Adds template proofs which utilize number citation
4. Document margins which match the required 1" top and bottom (as closely as possible)
5. Left justified abstract in individual manuscript chapters of publication thesis
6. Forced uppercase of second level headings
7. Provides numbering (and inclusion in toc) of fourth level headings

Additional notes for the newest version of the mstthesis class (2017/02/07):

1. The publication-option thesis relies on use of the chapterbib package in order to deal with the issue of individual reference 
lists for each publication/manuscript chapter and, potentially, a bibliography for the other chapters in the thesis/dissertation.

2. In order to successfully compile the publication-option thesis template, the compile process must follow thesis steps:
  a. Add the package option “draft” to the chapterbib package.
  b. Compile the base tex file with LaTeX (pdflatex template.tex)
  c. BibTeX the base tex file and then, also the individual publication/manuscript chapters.
  d. Remove the “draft” package option and LaTeX the base tex file at least twice more to assemble the reference and bibliography
  lists as well as the table of contents.

3. Note, at this time, neither the class file nor the template provides support for multiple lists of symbols.  If this is 
something that you wish to implement, I would suggest use of the glossaries package available on CTAN.  At present, the provided 
templates make use of the nomencl package for a list of symbols.

This repository contains the OGS-approved class and template files for theses and dissertations at the 
Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri.

The following subdirectories are included:
 a. proofs:  pdf versions of the template using various class and format options.
 b. source_class: the ins and dtx files for the mstthesis class.
 c. source_template: the ins and dtx files for the templates based on the mstthesis class.
 d. template_pto: template files for a publication-option thesis or dissertation.
 e. template_rpc: template files for a report-class thesis or dissertation.

The template_pto and and template_rpc subdirectories contain a fully-functional template which can be used to verify 
a properly configured local LaTeX environment. If you do not know how to compile the provided template file, please begin by 
learning how to use LaTeX using one of the references recommended below.

The class and template files have been developed in a unix environment and, in my own environment, are compiled with a Makefile.  
The Makefiles are included but not necessary, depending upon your OS/environment.

Suggestions for improvement or identification of suspected bugs in the class or template files are welcome and may be directed 
to the author (khoman@mst.edu).  Please do not contact with questions about how to use LaTeX.

If you are new to LaTeX, recommended references for learning how to use LaTeX effectively are:
  a. The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX by Tobias Oethiker,
  b. LaTeX: A Document Preparation System by Leslie Lamport, and 
  c. LaTeX Wikibooks.
  
Guides for installation of a LaTeX environment on Windows OS or Mac OS are available on the website: howtotex.com.
